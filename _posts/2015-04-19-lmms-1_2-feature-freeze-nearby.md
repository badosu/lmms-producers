It looks like LMMS is close to a feature freeze for the 1.2 version
release.

This is the last step before a release candidate is provided.

For the 1.2 release there are a lot of exciting changes:

- Lots of crash fixes
- Many workflow improvements and bug fixes
- Descriptive messages on the loading screen
- An error report when a song can't be loaded properly
- A more consistent set of keybindings and new ones
- Some small visual changes
- Introduction and extensive use of sample exact models
- And many more...

As soon as some tasks are done a feature freeze will be set and
a release candidate will be available for testing.
