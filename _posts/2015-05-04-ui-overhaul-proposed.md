The designer [@budislav](https://github.com/budislav) has proposed a major
overhaul of the LMMS interface.

He already made contributions for the [ZynaddSubFx project](http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/)
, which currently uses the work as a guideline for the [3.0 milestone](https://github.com/fundamental/zyn-ui-two).

The proposal for LMMS follows the same identity of his [previous work](http://budislavtvp.deviantart.com/art/ZynAddSubFX-UI-Concept-2014-455890191), which may be good for future integrations.

The fundamental difference is the single window workflow, which is more aligned
to the behaviour of many modern DAWs, this may be an advantage or not.

Certainly this means progress for many users and can help LMMS to get interest
by showing signs of 'maturity'.

Even though the current implementation is too far away to have any
reasonable expectation on the short time, it is a good pointer for
future discussions.

You can find the original proposal and more details on the
[github issue](https://github.com/LMMS/lmms/issues/1911), or check the
original work directly on [deviantart](http://budislavtvp.deviantart.com/art/LMMS-UI-Concept-2015-Single-Window-523696539).
