The designer [@budislav](https://github.com/budislav) has proposed a major
overhaul of the LMMS interface.

They have already made contributions for the [ZynaddSubFx project](http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/)
, which currently uses the work as a guideline for the [2.0 milestone](https://github.com/fundamental/zyn-ui-two).

The proposal for LMMS follows the same identity of the [previous work](http://budislavtvp.deviantart.com/art/ZynAddSubFX-UI-Concept-2014-455890191), which may be good for future integrations.

The fundamental difference is the single window workflow, which is more aligned
to the way many modern DAWs behave, this may be an advantage or not.

But certainly this means progress for many users and can help LMMS to get
interest by showing signs of 'maturity'.

Even though the current implementation is too far away to have any
reasonable expectation for the short time, it is a good pointer for
future discussions.

See some of the mockups:
